# Mini-Game

Due to the multifaceted aspects of a full game, including economic expansion, military development, diplomatic negotiations, cultural construction, and technological research, we have devised mini games to address each component individually. Each mini-game is designed with specific objectives, varying difficulty levels, step-based rewards, and an overall game score. The designed details could be found in the [paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=UBVNwD3hPN).

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to

* Understand the basic setting of mini-game
* Initialize mini-game by using API for random initialization or manual specification
* Create a new mini-game by yourself

## üéÆ Setting
### üèÅ Game Status

To describe whether a mini-game is over, the game-ending conditions include:

* The game score being greater than or equal to the goal score
* Reaching the maximum number of rounds set for the game

The enumerated values are as follows:
```python title="src/civrealm/envs/freeciv_minitask_env.py"
@unique
class MinitaskGameStatus(ExtendedEnum):
    MGS_END_GAME = 1
    MGS_IN_GAME = 0
```

### üî• Game Difficulty
Based on the richness of terrain resources, the comparison of unit quantities, and other information, we designed the difficulty level of the mini-game.

The enumerated values are as follows:
```python title="src/civrealm/envs/freeciv_minitask_env.py"
@unique
class MinitaskDifficulty(ExtendedEnum):
    MD_EASY = 'easy'
    MD_NORMAL = 'normal'
    MD_HARD = 'hard'
```

### üèÜ Victory Status

In the mini-game, the player‚Äôs current victory status can be represented as: failure, success, and unknown. The unknown state signifies that the game has not yet concluded, while the determination of failure and success only occurs after the game ends.

The enumerated values are as follows:
```python title="src/civrealm/envs/freeciv_minitask_env.py"
@unique
class MinitaskPlayerStatus(ExtendedEnum):
    MPS_SUCCESS = 1
    MPS_FAIL = 0
    MPS_UNKNOWN = -1
```
### üó∫Ô∏è Supported Types

We have designed the following 10 types of mini-games:

    <tr> 
        <td bgcolor="Lavender"><b>Category</b></td>
        <td bgcolor="Lavender"><b>ID</b></td>
        <td bgcolor="Lavender"><b>Name</b></td>

        <td>Against enemy invasion for a certain number of turns.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

        <td>10</td>
        <td>diplomacy_trade_tech</td>
        <td>Trade technologies with another civilization.</td>
    </tr>

</table>

The enumerated values are as follows:
```python title="src/civrealm/envs/freeciv_minitask_env.py"
@unique
class MinitaskType(ExtendedEnum):
    MT_DEVELOPMENT_BUILD_CITY = "development_build_city"
    MT_DEVELOPMENT_CITYTILE_WONDER = "development_citytile_wonder"
    MT_DEVELOPMENT_BUILD_INFRA = "development_build_infra"
    MT_DEVELOPMENT_TRANSPORT = "development_transport"
    MT_BATTLE_ANCIENT = "battle_ancient_era"
    MT_BATTLE_INDUSTRY = "battle_industry_era"

    MT_BATTLE_DEFEND_CITY = "battle_defend_city"
    MT_DIPLOMACY_TRADE_TECH = "diplomacy_trade_tech"
```

## Prepare Dataset

<b>Before you start the mini-game</b>, you need to load the mini-game designed archives into the server‚Äôs laoding archive path.

The steps are as follows:

<b>Step 1: </b> find your used version on the releases page, and download the data files for the mini-game to your local path such as `/tmp/minigame/`

<b>Step 2: </b> copy the data files, and extract them into the corresponding docker savegame path. If the docker image is `freeciv-web`, and the tomcat version is `10`, then execute the following commands:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
image="freeciv-web"
tomcat_version="tomcat10"
local_path="/tmp/minigame/"

mkdir $local_path
cd $local_path
docker exec -it $image rm -r /var/lib/$tomcat_version/webapps/data/savegames/minitask/
docker exec -it $image mkdir -p /var/lib/$tomcat_version/webapps/data/savegames/minitask/
for minitask_zip in `ls`
do
    docker cp $minitask_zip $image:/var/lib/$tomcat_version/webapps/data/savegames/minitask/
    docker exec -it $image unzip -o /var/lib/$tomcat_version/webapps/data/savegames/minitask/$minitask_zip -d /var/lib/$tomcat_version/webapps/data/savegames/minitask/
    docker exec -it $image rm /var/lib/$tomcat_version/webapps/data/savegames/minitask/$minitask_zip
done
```

## Initialize Random Mini-Game

`freeciv/FreecivMinitask-v0` is the environment of mini-game. When the mini game is launched, its internal design will randomly select a game of any type and any difficulty.

```python
from civrealm.agents import ControllerAgent
import gymnasium

env = gymnasium.make('freeciv/FreecivMinitask-v0')
agent = ControllerAgent()
observations, info = env.reset()
```

## Choose Specific Mini-Game

Inside `reset` method of environment, you can use the parameter `minitask_pattern` to choose specific mini-game. The fields are as follows:

`type`: the type of mini-game, see the available options MinitaskType

`level`: the difficulty of mini-game, see the available options MinitaskDifficulty

`id`: the id of mini-game, the available range is 0 to MAX_ID

For example, if you want to set the type as `development_build_city` and the difficulty as `easy`, then the code is as follows:
```python
from civrealm.agents import ControllerAgent
import gymnasium

env = gymnasium.make("freeciv/FreecivMinitask-v0")
observations, info = env.reset(minitask_pattern={
    "type": "development_build_city", 
    "level": "easy"})
```

## Definition of Mini-game messages
The messages of mini-game are passed from the server to the agent at each trigger point by lua script setting. The general json structure of message is:
```json
{
    "task": "minitask",
    "name": "${name of minitask}",
    "status": ${MinitaskGameStatus},
    "turn": ${turn of game},
    "metrics": [{
        "mini_score": ${mini_score},
        "mini_goal": ${mini_goal},
        "max_turn": ${max_turn},
        "is_mini_success": ${MinitaskPlayerStatus},
    }]
}
```

* The `task` is used to label the source of message. The `task` for messages from mini-game is set to be `minitask`.

* The final element of `metrics` records the final game review status for each trigger action, which is actually used in civrealm. In the dict structure of `metrics` elements, we can  define other useful auxiliary information

* The `metrics.mini_score` is used to record the agent's mini-game score.

* The `metrics.mini_goal` is used to record the agent's mini-game goal, which is to set the game victory score threshold.

* The `metrics.max_turn` is limited to a certain number of turns. If the maximum number of turns is exceeded, failure is returned in civrealm.

* The `metrics.is_mini_success` is used to record the player succeed status of player, which is the same as `success` defined of minitask info in civrealm. If succeed, it requires that `mini_score>=mini_goal`.

## Play mini-game as a random agent

Generally speaking, it is difficult for random agents to win the battle and diplomacy mini-game, and in the development mini-game, the game victory condition will be met with a certain probability.

The commands are as follows:
```bash
cd civrealm/
python src/civrealm/random_game_minitask.py
```

After executing the commands, the log will be like:
```log
Step: 0, Turn: 1, Reward: 0.0, Terminated: False, Truncated: False, Action: ('tech', 'cur_player', 'set_tech_goal_Conscription_18')
        Minitask Info: {'status': 0, 'success': -1, 'human_cnt': 11.0, 'ai_cnt': 12.0, 'mini_score': -1.0, 'mini_goal': 11.0, 'max_turn': 50, 'human_leader_alive': 1, 'ai_leader_alive': 1, 'is_mini_success': -1}
Step: 1, Turn: 1, Reward: 0.0, Terminated: False, Truncated: False, Action: ('unit', 108, 'goto_1')
        Minitask Info: {'status': 0, 'success': -1, 'human_cnt': 11.0, 'ai_cnt': 12.0, 'mini_score': -1.0, 'mini_goal': 11.0, 'max_turn': 50, 'human_leader_alive': 1, 'ai_leader_alive': 1, 'is_mini_success': -1}
```

In the log, We can see that each step displays some fields from the above definitions as `Definition of Mini-game messages`, and some are auxiliary fields designed by mini-game itself such as `human_leader_alive`.

## Create new Mini-Game

The general pipeline of creating new mini-game is as follows:

<div align=center>
```mermaid
graph TD
    A(Be clear about \nwhat to do) --> B(Generate basic archive)
    B --> D(Use gtk tool to edit elements)
    D --> F(Add trigger actions by lua script)
    F --> C{Mini-Game Validation\n In Freeciv-Web}
    C --> |Not Pass| D 
    C --> |Pass| E(Large batch auto random generation)
    E --> H{Mini-Game Validation\n In Civrealm}
    H --> |Not Pass| D
    H --> |Pass| I(Create new Mini-Game successfully)

```
</div>

### Be clear about what to do

The basic design mechanisms of mini-game are:

* <b>Single Goal.</b> Don't consider multiple learning objectives at the same time, otherwise the game will become less mini after more influences are introduced.

* <b>Feasible Action.</b> In the huge space of action, be clear about which actions are relevant to your goal, and avoid too many unrelated or paradoxical actions in actionable actions.

* <b>Computable Reward.</b> In addition to the final score at the end of the game, the reward for each step or turn can be defined and calculated.

At the beginning of designing a mini-game, you have to answer the following questions:

* What type of the mini-game?

* When does the mini-game end?

* How to calculate the reward for each step?

* How to set the difficulty of the game? 

These questions will be given appropriate suggestions to some extent below.

### Generate basic archive

### Use gtk tool to edit elements

### Add trigger actions by lua script

!!! Warning
    Because the fields in the sav file have dependencies on each other, if you modify a field without noticing some other fields that need to be modified at the same time, it will cause the server to load the sav file unsuccessfully.

Before modifying the game archive, you need to understand the archive format of freeciv and how it defines the game state internally.

* The suffix of the game archive file is `.sav`, and usually compressed as a compressed file with `.xz` or `.zst` suffix. If the archive file is compressed, you need to use the corresponding component to decompress it to get the sav file.

* In the sav file, there are many key-value structures to describe the current game state. Here, We list the main tags and their explanations:

<table>
    <tr> 
        <td bgcolor="Lavender"><b>Tag</b></td>
        <td bgcolor="Lavender"><b>Description</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
        <td>savefile</td>
        <td>A set of definition rules for common elements, including activity, technology, etc.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
        <td>game</td>
        <td>The base state values of the game, such as turn, launch order and year.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
        <td>script</td>
        <td>The script of lua. At the inherent or designed trigger points of the game, obtain the internal data of the game, calculate the custom game state values, and send out event messages.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
        <td>settings</td>
        <td>The setting of freeciv server.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
        <td>map</td>
        <td>The global map of world, and distribution information of resources, cities, and land development.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>player0</td>
        <td>The game status of a player with an id of 0, including information such as how many units and cities the player0 have. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
        <td>score0</td>
        <td>The scores of a player with an id of 0, including information such as total score and unhappy degree.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>research</td>
        <td>The progress of research for each player. </td>
    </tr>
</table>
