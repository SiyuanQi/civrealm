The following are some common issues that you may encounter when running the code. If you encounter any other issues, please feel free to open an issue.

* If firefox keeps loading the page, please try to add the following line to `/etc/hosts`:

    ```bash
    127.0.0.1 maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com
    127.0.0.1 cdn.webglstats.com
    ```

* If you encounter the following error when running `sudo civ_prep_selenium.sh`, please try [this solution](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/724518/the-following-packages-have-unmet-dependencies-containerd-io).

    ```bash
    ...
    The following packages have unmet dependencies:
    containerd.io : Conflicts: containerd
                    Conflicts: runc
    ...
    ```

* If you see the following error when running `test_civrealm`,  please see [this solution](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72405117/selenium-geckodriver-profile-missing-your-firefox-profile-cannot-be-loaded). If this does not solve the problem, please check `geckodriver.log` for more information.

    ```bash
    selenium.common.exceptions.WebDriverException: Message: Process unexpectedly closed with status 1
    ```

    One potential solution on Ubuntu 22.04 is:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install firefox-geckodriver
    ln -s /snap/bin/firefox.geckodriver geckodriver
    ```

* If you see the following error when setting `take_screenshot: True`, it is caused by snap version of Firefox. Please try [System Firefox installation](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/install-firefox-linux#w_install-firefox-from-mozilla-builds-for-advanced-users).

  ```bash
  Your Firefox profile cannot be loaded. 
  It may be missing or inaccessible.
  ```

* If the screenshot is not centered on the location of your first unit, it is because you are using multiple displays. Please ensure the Firefox browser for screenshot pops up on your primary display.
