 # *CivRealm*: A Learning and Reasoning Odyssey in *Civilization* for Decision-Making Agents
 
-[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/openreview-py/badge/?version=latest)](<http://civilization.pages.mybigai.ac.cn/civrealm>)
+[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/openreview-py/badge/?version=latest)](<https://bigai-ai.github.io/civrealm/>)
 
-CivRealm is an interactive environment for the open-source strategy game [Freeciv-web](https://github.com/freeciv/freeciv-web) based on [Freeciv](https://www.freeciv.org/), a Civilization-inspired game. Within CivRealm, we provide interfaces for two typical agent types: tensor-based reinforcement learning agents (see [Tensor-agent Repo](https://gitlab.mybigai.ac.cn/civilization/freeciv-tensor-baseline)) based on the [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) API, and language-based agents (see [LLM-agent Repo](http://civilization.pages.mybigai.ac.cn/civrealm)) powered by language models.

 We also provide a set of tools for training and evaluating agents, as well as a set of baselines for both agent type. We hope that CivRealm can serve as a testbed for developing and evaluating agents that can learn and reason in complex environments. For detailed usages on the civrealm API, please refer to [Documentation](http://civilization.pages.mybigai.ac.cn/civrealm).
